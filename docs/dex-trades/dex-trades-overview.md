# DEX Traders Overview

## Introduction

In faStock Exchange, an application built on top of faStock-Chain, users who want to exchange tokens are called DEX Traders.

faStock Exchange is the first project of the faStock-Chain ecosystem, and represents a middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of “everyone can create DEX”, it provides various basic functions needed to operate a DEX.


## Get market information

faStock Exchange provides essential functions. Orders and matching occur on-chain, but these are not enough. The user experience has to be friendly and to help traders make their trading decisions in a frictionless manner.The faStock-Chain community welcomes all developers to participate in developing and strengthening the faStock ecosystem.

faStock-Chain itself is an open source project allowing anyone to develop their own set of UI to enable DEX Traders to make better trading decisions.
