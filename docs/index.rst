Introduction
============

What is faStock-Chain?
-----------------

faStock-Chain is a set of open-source blockchain projects developed by faStock,
aiming to promote the development of large-scale commercial applications
based on blockchain technology. It gives each participating node the
same rights, allowing users to launch a variety of decentralized applications
smoothly, issue their digital assets, create their own digital asset trading
pairs, and trade freely. The utilisation of cross-chain technology principles
is essential to allow those features to be used by anyone. Through the
cross-chain module, the value interconnectivity and user interconnectivity,
interconnectivity of blockchain can be realized simply and efficiently,
so that we can co-construct the ecosystem and the value-added system.

What is faStock Exchange?
-----------------

The faStock Exchange, was the first project born from the faStock-Chain ecosystem
and is a middleware that can freely issue DEX. With the design concept of
“everyone can create DEX”, it provides various basic functions needed to operate
a DEX. Compared with traditional DEX, faStock adopts a full on-chain matching and
an on-chain order book management to make matching information more transparent
and safe; compared with Ethereum-based projects, the matching engine based on
faStock-Chain’s call auction can achieve matching in seconds, which is similar to
the operating experience offered by centralized exchange. In addition, its unique
design idea is not to build a DEX belonging to a certain stakeholder, but to provide
a platform to achieve the separation of technology and operations. Just as Ethereum
makes digital asset issuance simple through smart contract technology, faStock-Chain
lowers the barrier for operating digital asset trading pairs with faStock.

The OKT
-------

Do you have OKT tokens? With OKT, you have the unique ability to contribute
to the security and governance of the faStock-Chain. Delegate your OKT to one
or more of the 100 validators on the faStock-Chain blockchain to earn more OKT
through Proof-of-Stake. You can also vote with your OKT to influence the
future of the faStock-Chain through on-chain governance proposals.

Learn more about `being a
delegator <./delegators/delegators-faq.html>`__.

faStock-Chain Explorer
------------------

The faStock-Chain block explorer allows you to search, view and analyze faStock-Chain
data—like blocks, transactions, validators as well as other key information

-  `OKlink <https://www.oklink.com>`__

faStock-Chain CLI
-------------

``fastock-chain-cli`` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with
the faStock-Chain. ``fastock-chain-cli`` is the only tool that supports 100% of the
faStock-Chain features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and
governance. Learn more about ``fastock-chain-cli`` with the delegator’s CLI
`guide <./delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html>`__.

Running a full-node on the faStock-Chain Testnet
--------------------------------------------

In order to run a full-node on the faStock-Chain testnet, you must first
`install fastock-chain-daemon <./getting-start/install-fastock-chain.html>`__. Then,
follow `the guide <./getting-start/install-fastock-chain.html>`__.

If you would like to run a validator node, follow the validator setup
`guide <./validators/validators-guide-cli.html>`__.
